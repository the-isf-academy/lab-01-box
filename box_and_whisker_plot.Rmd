# Box-and-whisker plot using Python + Turtle
### Oct 2019
### Credits and References: bit.ly/2cUdV5Y, bit.ly/2BtdoWI





# üßÆTHE MATH PART

In this section of the jupyter notebook, your group will be performing the calculations for the box and whisker plot.



### 1. Set Up the Data


**Q: What data types are we working with?**  

üî¢For a Box-and-whisker plot, we can use either a **list of integers or a list of floats**.

**Q: What data are we working with?**  

‚úåÔ∏èWe're going to give you two data sets.

Right now, you will work with `test_data`, a simple integer list.

`actual_data` is much longer. This is the actual data we want to plot.

```{python}
test_data = [6, 4, 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, 9, 3]
```

### 2. Sort the Data


**üíªTODO:** Write a function to sort a list so that it is in ascending order.

```{python}
# YOUR FUNCTION DEFINITION
```

**‚úÖDone?** Test your code by running your sort function. data_points should be sorted in ascending order.

```{python}
#Test your function with a function call here. 
```

### 3. Work out Calculations  


**üíªTODO:** Functions to calculate the median, minimum, maximum, range, lower quartile, and upper quartile. Feel free to add more cells if you need it.

```{python}
# YOUR FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
```

**‚úÖDone?** Test your code by running your functions on `test_data` below. Are the values the same if you calculate it by hand? You can also change sorted_test_data.

```{python}
#Test your function with a function call here. 
```

### 4. Great! Now let's repeat steps 1,2, and 3 with the actual data we want to graph.


We'll do step 1 for you. The 2 lines below will take one column from our social media use results (stored in a csv file) and turn it into a list.

The data we're using is a list of responses to this question: "How many social media accounts do you have?"

```{python}
from helpers import get_database_as_list
```

```{python}
actual_data = get_database_as_list('social_media_use.csv', 'Social media accounts', (0,100))
```

**üíªTODO:** Sort the list `actual_data` using your sort list function. Then create 5 variables to store the 5 calculations your functions will return.

```{python}
# YOUR FUNCTION CALLS
```

# üé® THE DRAWING PART

In this section of the jupyter notebook, your group will be drawing the calculations for the box and whisker plot.


```{python}
from turtle import *
from helpers import plot, scale, no_delay, restore_state_when_finished
```

**üíªTODO:** Functions to draw the box and whiskers. 

```{python}
# YOUR FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
```
<!-- #region -->
# üß©PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Here is where you can call the drawing functions your group writes.


We've already given you the function `plot()` in the `helpers.py` module with code to set up the settings and draw the axis of the plot. You need to pass in two things to this function:

* the data points you used as a `list`
* the label for the axis as a `string`

This function will return a `plot_settings` dictionary with the settings for the box and whisker plot.

üíª **TO DO:** Run the cell below to see what settings we're working with.

üíª **TO DO:** Then, add your drawing functions to draw the plot.
<!-- #endregion -->
```{python}
clearscreen()
plot_settings = {}
with no_delay():
    plot_settings = plot(actual_data, 'Social media accounts')
    #ADD YOUR FUNCTIONS HERE
plot_settings
```
