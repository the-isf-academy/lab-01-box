# Box and Whisker Plot Lab

This repository holds databases and Jupyter notebooks which students will use to create code to draw box and whisker plots.

Students will be challenged to decompose the problem on their own and then work in groups to delegate and write the code.

## Jupyter Notebook Workflow

As a reminder, the workflow for using Jupyter notebooks with git is as follows:

* `git clone` or `git pull` the Jupyter notebook repo to your local directory
* run `jupyter notebook` in your working directory
* open the .Rmb file
* Save cmd+S the file
* Close and halt the .Rmb file
* Open the .ipynb file and edit as usual (this will save the output as usual while automatically updating the .Rmb file)
